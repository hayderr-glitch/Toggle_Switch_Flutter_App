# Toggle Switch App

A simple Flutter application demonstrating the use of a `Switch` widget to control the state of other widgets. Toggling the switch changes the text content and the color of a container.

## Features

- A central `Switch` widget to toggle the state.
- A `Text` widget that displays "On" or "Off" based on the switch's state.
- A `Container` that changes its color between green ("On") and red ("Off").
- Demonstrates basic state management in Flutter using `StatefulWidget` and `setState`.

## Screenshots

Here's what the app looks like in both states.

*(Note: To display these images, create a `screenshots` folder in the project's root directory. Run the app, take a screenshot for both the "On" and "Off" states, name them `screenshot_on.png` and `screenshot_off.png` respectively, and place them inside the `screenshots` folder.)*

| Off State | On State |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="screenshots/screenshot_off.png" alt="App in Off State" width="250"/> | <img src="screenshots/screenshot_on.png" alt="App in On State" width="250"/> |
